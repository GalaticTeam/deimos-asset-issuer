- Create issuing and distribution accounts
- Create the trustline between distribution and issuing accounts
- Issue an asset and send it to distribution account
- Manage the issuing account
- Manage the asset (inflating supply, revoking access, limit holder accounts, etc)
- Generate stellar.toml file

- Create mass requesting for trustlines
- Create mass asset distribution strategies
- Daily use of assets - send and receive - supported by a specialized stellar network assets mobile wallet
- More complex transactions schemas (multi-signatures)
